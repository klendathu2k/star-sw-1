StarEtc directory contains different auxiliary files for STAT+ROOT

1. 601600.rootrc rootrc file for ROOT.60.16.00. To run ROOT must do copy:
   cp 601600.rootrc ~/.rootrc 

2. rootlogon.C ROOT logon which is called on init

3. STAR.h include file with the set of popular STAR includes  used in macros.
   for instance in bfc.C

4 source skip_dirs.csh
  An example how to skip compilation of non desirable directories

5.updRDict.csh This mmacro is a temmporary  solution. It ust be the part of "cons"
  All the *pcm fules creared by Cling must be linked to $STARSYS/lib
  When this will be done this file will be remmoved.

6 source rootnodeb.csh 
  Initialisation of Root 6.16.00

7. agmlupd.csh acro to compile & update AGML stuff.

How to copile everything.
Unfortunatelly in cons still existing soe bugs. As a result some dependency
are not correct. But compilation still possible
